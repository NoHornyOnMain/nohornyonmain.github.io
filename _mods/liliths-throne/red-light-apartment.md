# Things to Note
- Located in the red-light district (same tile as the Angel's Kiss).
- Requires you to have met Angel first (simply enter the Angel's Kiss and talk to her).
- Rent costs 3,750 flames per month.
    - The option will only appear if you have read the sign and have enough money.
    - You can stack as many months as you'd like; each payment extends your rent by 30 days.

# Known Issues
- The apartment is not accessible when leaving the Angel's Kiss.
    - As a workaround, simply walk away one tile and walk back.
- Flavour text for the player's bedroom doesn't make a lot of sense in context.
    - This is because it re-uses the room from Lilaya's house.
- You can fast travel from the bedroom in the apartment as if you were in Lilaya's house.
    - This is similarly due to re-using the room from Lilaya's house.
- The override encounter 'follows' the player off the red-light district tile.
    - This is ultimately harmless, but very much unintentional and can cause a lot of errors to appear in the log.
