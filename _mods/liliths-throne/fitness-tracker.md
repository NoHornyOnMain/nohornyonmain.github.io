# Things to Note
- The watches won't spawn naturally so you'll have to get one from the debug menu or edit the mod so it does spawn naturally (comment out line #106 in fitness_tracker.xml).
- Like [the previously released smartwatch](./smartwatch), this is purely cosmetic for now.
    - I did, however, once again use the sticker system to allow for changeable watch faces. The mod comes with five by default (blank, digital, digital w/ steps, digital w/ heartrate, analogue) as well as a template for you to create your own.
