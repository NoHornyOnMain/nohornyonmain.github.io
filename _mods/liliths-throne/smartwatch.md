# Things to Note
- The watches won't spawn naturally so you'll have to get one from the debug menu or edit the mod so it does spawn naturally (comment out line #84 in smartwatch.xml).
- As far as I can tell, functional watches are still too hardcoded for modded ones to be a possibility so this is purely cosmetic for now.
    - I did, however, use the sticker system to allow for changeable watch faces. The mod comes with three by default (blank, digital, analogue) as well as a template for you to create your own.
